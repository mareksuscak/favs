The collection is divided into multiple categories and is subject for further reorganisation sooner or later. This is just a small part of [my second brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOKxSFB2hOE&t=218s) that I've been building for a while now.

I keep great content in Instapaper, Apple Notes, Notepad, Text files in DropBox, Browser bookmarks, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLta_Oz8mBtxDVa1YkQ7Bszd_jU7Yrwi61), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/mareksuscak/likes) and Ted playlists, bookshelf, etc.
